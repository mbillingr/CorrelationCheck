This Android app lets you take pictures of scatter plots with the device's integrated camera and compute correlations on these scatter plots.

As this is my first Android project I have no idea what files need to be included in the repository and which files are not required. To start with, I only added sources.
The project was created in Android Studio with the gradle (?) build tool and uses OpenCV. If there is anything more required to build the project don't hesitate to create an Issue here on Github.
